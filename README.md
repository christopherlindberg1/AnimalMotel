# Animal Motel Desktop application

The application is built for a fictional animal motel so they can keep track of animals and related data.

## Purpose
The application is a school assignment and the purpose is to develope a solid understanding of object oriented programming and how to write robust and well structured applications in C#.

## Features
* Add animals of different species and specify values for the characteristics that are relevant for that specie.
* Edit & delete animals.
* Sort the list with animals by any characteristic.
* Register staff and recipes.

## What I learned
* I learned more about the importance of structuring applications well from the start so that they are easy to maintain and that new features can be added without having to rewrite and/or change a lot of code. 
* Applying polymorphism in a real world app. I had never used interfaces or abstract classes before, but now I know why they are so useful.
* Maintaining state in the GUI at all times. I had to determine which "GUI-manipulating methods" should be created for efficient manipulation of the GUI when the user did certain actions.

## Built with
* C#
* Winforms - Creating the GUI and events.
